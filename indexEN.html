            <h1>Hello there! My name is Kristoffer.</h1>
            <p> 
              I'm a front-end developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Figma. 
              I've held interests in all things technology, computers and language since early childhood. 
              My education has taken me through learning all the basics of front-end development in a 
              coding bootcamp called Kodehode, learning basic design, Adobe Illustrator and InDesign in 
              highschool and learning Japanese language and about Japanese culture in a university programme 
              with a year in Japan as an exchange student.
              I like to think that learning human languages and learning computer languages have similarities, 
              and that my interest in both serves me well. Learning new stuff is something I love, so if I 
              don't know something yet, it fuels my interest and inspiration to learn.
              In my free time you'll find me playing games like Final Fantasy 14, Path of Exile or Terraria, 
              as well as trying to keep my Japanese from rusting too much by watching anime and consuming 
              other Japanese media. I also enjoy tinkering with my computer's setup and  planning hardware upgrades. 
              I enjoy programming in my free time too, and I'm always keeping an eye out for new skills to 
              master next on my coding and programming journey.
